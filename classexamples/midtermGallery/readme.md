# Functions

I made an interactive gallery that displays the images from behind the scenes of a short indie horror film. The goal for this project was to create a simple, clean, and easy to use slideshow.
This is a test run for a bigger idea I have for the final project. I hoping to build off the skills I used and learned from this project to apply it.
